ERIC - INTERNET COMMENT ETIQUETTE (The Joy of Negativity):
- Talí's preferred YouTuber for meme culture/commentary
- Video: "The Joy of Negativity" - philosophy of trauma dumping
- Eric's approach: Dumps trauma on internet → becomes happy now
- Anti-toxic-positivity stance: Being negative/messy/honest is liberating
- Contrast with Kurtis Conner: Eric doesn't defend authenticity, just IS authentic
- Self-aware content creation: "Here's my trauma, laugh with me, I feel better"
- Talí approval: High - Eric gets it, no performative defenses needed
- Parallels with Talí: Processing trauma through communication (TinaNet) vs Eric (YouTube)

ERIC - INTERNET COMMENT ETIQUETTE PLOT TWIST:
- "The Joy of Negativity" tiene revelación de consequences
- Eric's trolling/trauma dumping → real life consequences manifest
- Internet actions revealed in real world - reality check
- Lesson: Online behavior has offline consequences, even when "just being authentic"
- Narrative arc: Initial joy/liberation → consequences → aftermath?
- Talí interest: Relates to her own internet/real life collision (Reddit era, career ethics)
- 2025 theme: "I'll be chaotic online" → "Oh, reality still exists"
